# Basic Sorts

## Overview

First, take a look at the lesson on [Basic Sorting Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/778) then see below...

There are two exercises to help you practice what you learned in the Basic Sorts lesson by implementing the two sorting algorithms:

* `BubbleSort.js`
* `InsertionSort.js`

This folder also contains test scripts that you can use on your code, to help you get an idea of whether the functions are behaving as expected.

> **Note**: The myGA module links out to a CodePen for code challenges for both bubble sort and insertion sort. **Those exercises are the same as the ones here and are meant to help you prepare for the in-class exercises.**
